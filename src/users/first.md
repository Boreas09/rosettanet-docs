## First deposit

In order to use Rosettanet, your account has to be funded with STRKs and deployed on chain. So first you have to learn your Ethereum address actual Starknet contract address equivalent.
This can be done through the Rosettanet dashboard or manually retrieved via the Rosettanet registry contract. 

## How to find the actual Starknet address?

TBD

## How to deploy my account?

Your account will be deployed in your first transaction. Your first transaction from your wallet won't be executed. A current limitation of Starknet is that it can not let us modify the nonces of account contracts, so this is our current approach to deploying accounts. However, this can be changed further.

## What happens next?

Once your first transaction is completed. You will be able to use your wallet with your favourite Starknet protocols.
